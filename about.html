<p id="p2" class="about-description">
  I am an Agile Software Developer, with a master degree in Computer Science. I love learning about
  different technologies and always be up to date.
  <br/>
  During my working years I've noticed the lack of womens in the companies I've worked on.
  I wanted to do something about it, so I recently embarked on a mission to bring together
  all Italian Tech Girls, if you feel you are one of them
  then join <a class="pink_link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J2L_4tY8UCakGOxMAVryrVHKHFzmIVFo3DDq9fdOjFg/edit?usp=mail_response_notification">here</a>.
  Sometimes I do workshops on different things, where I help girls to learn programming!
  <br />
  <br />
  I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned back.
  If you have any doubts about stuff in programming, or if you are a newbie and do not understand something
  or just want a body with whom to do some exercising,
  I have started recently an <a id="link" class="pink_link" href="#" onclick="open();">Ask Me Anything</a> test.
  Just drop me a question and once a week I will get one and do a pair session with you.
  <br/>
  Aaaand it's totally free :)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just send me a message if you have a question about me or would like to get in touch.
